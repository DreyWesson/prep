For a Frontend Engineer interview at Trivago, especially with a focus on hotel search, you could be asked to implement various types of functionality that test your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React. Here are some examples of what you might be asked to implement:

User interface coding
Build user interfaces (can be a UI component, an app, or a game) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Components
Autocomplete (very popular)
Photo gallery
Image carousel
Tooltip component
Star rating widget
Apps
Build tic-tac-toe
Build a chess board with movable pieces

1. Dynamic UI Components
Hotel Listing Component: Implement a hotel listing component that displays a list of hotels with details like name, price, rating, and image. You might be asked to sort or filter these listings based on certain criteria (e.g., price, rating).
Search and Filter Functionality: Implement a search bar that filters the hotel listings based on user input. You might also need to add filters (e.g., by star rating, amenities) and ensure that the UI updates dynamically.
2. Responsive Design
Responsive Grid Layout: Create a responsive grid layout for displaying hotel search results. Ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices, maintaining usability and visual appeal.
Mobile-First Design: Implement a mobile-first design for a component or page, ensuring that it works well on smaller screens and enhances as the screen size increases.
3. State Management and React Hooks
Use of React Context: Implement a theme toggle (light/dark mode) using React Context. Ensure that the selected theme is applied across multiple components (e.g., header, footer, main content).
Form Handling: Create a form for users to input search criteria (e.g., destination, check-in/check-out dates) and display the results based on the form submission. You may be asked to manage form state using React hooks.
4. Performance Optimization
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images in a hotel listing to improve page performance. Only load images as they come into view (using Intersection Observer or a similar technique).
Code Splitting: Split a React application into multiple chunks to improve load times. You may be asked to use React's lazy and Suspense to achieve this.
5. Data Fetching and API Integration
Fetching Data with GraphQL: If you have experience with GraphQL, you might be asked to fetch and display data from a GraphQL API. Implement queries and handle the data in your React components.
Debounced Search: Implement a search bar that fetches suggestions from an API as the user types. Use debouncing to limit the number of API calls, ensuring efficient data fetching.
6. Custom Hooks and Reusable Components
Custom Hook: Create a custom React hook to manage form state or handle API requests, then use it in multiple components to demonstrate reusability.
Reusable Button Component: Implement a reusable button component that can be easily customized (e.g., different styles, sizes, icons) and used throughout the application.
7. Accessibility Implementation
Accessible Form: Implement an accessible form that includes proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and error handling for users with disabilities.
ARIA Roles and Semantics: Enhance an existing UI component with proper ARIA roles and semantic HTML to ensure it meets accessibility standards.
8. Animation and User Interaction
Smooth Transitions: Add smooth transitions to a UI component, such as expanding/collapsing sections or sliding in a sidebar.
Interactive Map: Implement an interactive map where users can select a location and see nearby hotels. You might be asked to integrate with a mapping API like Google Maps or Leaflet.
9. Live Coding Tasks
Coding Challenges: During the live coding session, you might be asked to solve algorithmic problems that involve DOM manipulation, data processing (e.g., filtering or sorting arrays), or implementing specific UI components.
Debugging: You may be given a piece of code with bugs and asked to identify and fix the issues while explaining your thought process.
10. Design and Architecture Discussions
Component Design: Discuss how you would architect a complex feature like a hotel comparison tool, where users can compare multiple hotels side-by-side.
Scalability Considerations: Explain how you would design a component or application to scale, ensuring maintainability and performance as the app grows.
11. Code Review and Best Practices
Refactoring Task: You might be given an existing piece of code and asked to refactor it for readability, performance, or to follow best practices (e.g., DRY, SOLID principles).
Code Review Simulation: Participate in a simulated code review where you're asked to evaluate a pull request, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements.
12. Testing
Unit and Integration Testing: Implement unit tests for a component using a testing framework like Jest or React Testing Library. You might also be asked to write integration tests for more complex interactions.
These examples cover a broad range of tasks that test your technical expertise and your ability to think critically about building user-friendly, performant, and scalable applications. Each task not only assesses your coding skills but also your understanding of best practices, your ability to handle real-world challenges, and your readiness to contribute to Trivago's engineering team.
