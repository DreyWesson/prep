Brush Up on Loops:

    Review the different types of loops available in the language you're using (e.g., for, while, do-while).

    Understand their syntax, use cases, and performance implications.

    Learn the built-in methods for arrays, strings, and other data structures in the language you'll be using (e.g., map, filter, reduce, split, join).

Practice Basic Operations:

    Work on problems involving array manipulation, such as traversing, filtering, mapping, and reducing arrays.
    Practice string manipulation tasks, like reversing a string, counting characters, and pattern matching.

Algorithmic Concepts:

    Refresh your knowledge on basic algorithms like searching (linear and binary search) and sorting (bubble sort, merge sort).
    Understand common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Understand Functional Programming Basics:

    Know how to use higher-order functions and lambda expressions.
    Understand immutability and pure functions, as these concepts are often emphasized in high-level programming.
