# Interaction Workflow

- User Authentication:
    - User logs in with their credentials (username and password).
    - Server verifies credentials and generates both an access token (short-lived and used to access protected resource) and a refresh token(long-lived, used to obtain new access tokens).

- Token Ditribution:
    - The access token is sent to the client (typically stored in memory).
    - The refresh token is sent and stored securely (e.g., in an httpOnly cookie), which helps protect it from being accessed by client-side scripts.

- Access Protected Resources:
    - Client includes the access token in the Authorization header of each request to the server.

- Token Expiration:
    - When the access token expires, the client needs to get a new one.
    - The client sends the refresh token to the server to get a new access token.

- Token Refresh Endpoint:
    - Server verifies the refresh token.
    - If valid, the server issues a new access token.
    - If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the user may need to log in again.
