# Core

- [x] Implement a responsive navigation bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.
- [x] Create a form with validation using HTML5 attributes and JavaScript.
- [ ] Create RESTful API endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a resource (e.g., users, products). and consume them in frontend
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- [ ] SQL, NoSQL
- [ ] Implement pagination for fetching large datasets from a database and handles fetching and displaying paginated data from an API.

Authentication, middleware etc. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in a Node.js application using middleware to restrict routes based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).
- [ ] Create a feature in your application that consumes data from a third-party API (e.g., weather API, news API) and displays it on the front-end.
- [ ] Design and implement a microservice that communicates with other services via RESTful APIs.
- [ ] Implement HTTPS, CSRF protection, and secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth) in your application.
- [ ] Develop a client-side search feature that filters and displays search results as users type into an input field.
- [ ] Design and animate a dropdown menu using CSS transitions or animations.
- [ ] Implement a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox that adjusts based on screen size.
- [ ] Create integration tests for an API endpoint that handles user registration and login.
- [ ] Use message queue systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka to enable asynchronous communication between microservices.
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes to improve the response time of API endpoints fetching large datasets.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.
- [ ] Harden the security of a web application by implementing HTTPS, securing sensitive API endpoints with JWT tokens, and handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) appropriately.
- [ ] Conduct a security audit of a web application to identify and fix vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
- [ ] Develop a feature to manage state using React Context API, ensuring data is shared across multiple components efficiently.
- [ ] Implement a drag-and-drop functionality using vanilla JavaScript or a library like React DnD.
- [ ] Implement server-side pagination and sorting for fetching a large dataset from a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- [ ] Create a cron job in Node.js to perform scheduled tasks (e.g., sending daily summary emails, clearing expired sessions).
- [ ] Write SQL queries to perform a full-text search across multiple columns in a relational database.
- [ ] Design and implement database migrations using tools like Knex.js or Sequelize to manage schema changes in a Node.js application.
- [ ] Develop a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system using Node.js and a library like Speakeasy for generating and validating OTPs (One-Time Passwords).
- [ ] Build a feature to import/export data in CSV format from a front-end React application to a back-end Node.js API.
- [ ] Implement WebSocket communication between a React front-end and a Node.js server to enable real-time collaboration in a collaborative editor application.
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress or Selenium to automate user interactions (e.g., login, form submission) in a web application.
- [ ] Develop unit tests for a RESTful API endpoint using Jest or Mocha/Chai to verify request handling and data manipulation logic.
- [ ] Design and implement a microservice architecture using Docker containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage deployment, scaling, and load balancing.
- [ ] Use event-driven architecture and message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka to enable communication between loosely coupled microservices.
- [ ] Optimize front-end performance by lazy loading images, minifying and bundling JavaScript and CSS assets, and implementing browser caching strategies.
- [ ] Implement database sharding or partitioning techniques to horizontally scale a relational database and handle increased load effectively.
- [ ] Conduct security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) on a web application to identify and mitigate security risks.
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization flow to secure API endpoints and allow third-party applications to access user data securely.
- [ ] Build a file upload API endpoint using Node.js and multer middleware, with support for handling different file types (e.g., images, documents).
- [ ] Implement WebSocket-based real-time notifications for a messaging feature in a Node.js application using Socket.io.
- [ ] Write optimized SQL queries to perform complex data manipulations (e.g., joining multiple tables, aggregating data) in a relational database.
- [ ] Develop a password hashing and salting mechanism in Node.js to securely store user passwords in a database.
- [ ] Design and implement a resilient communication strategy between microservices using service discovery and circuit breaker patterns (e.g., using Netflix Eureka and Hystrix).
Implement distributed tracing and monitoring for microservices architecture using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis caching, CDN caching) to improve the response time and reduce latency in a distributed system.
